            <p>
                Prometheus is a 2012 science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott, written by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof and starring
                Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, Guy Pearce, Idris Elba, Logan Marshall-Green and Charlize Theron. It is
                set in the late 21st century and centers on the crew of the spaceship Prometheus as it follows a star map
                discovered among the artifacts of several ancient Earth cultures. Seeking the origins of humanity, the crew
                arrives on a distant world and discovers a threat that could cause the extinction of the human species.
            </p>
            <p>
                Development of the film began in the early 2000s as a fifth installment in the Alien franchise. Scott and director James
                Cameron developed ideas for a film that would serve as a prequel to Scott's 1979 science-fiction horror film
                Alien. By 2003, the development of Alien vs. Predator took precedence, and the project remained dormant until
                2009 when Scott again showed interest. Spaihts wrote a script for a prequel to the events of the Alien films,
                but Scott opted for a different direction to avoid repeating cues from those films. In late 2010, Lindelof
                joined the project to rewrite Spaihts's script, and he and Scott developed a story that precedes the story
                of Alien but is not directly connected to that franchise. According to Scott, although the film shares "strands
                of Alien's DNA, so to speak", and takes place in the same universe, Prometheus explores its own mythology
                and ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prometheus entered production in April 2010, with extensive design phases during which the technology and creatures that
                the film required were developed. Principal photography began in March 2011, with an estimated US$120â€“130
                million budget. The project was shot using 3D cameras throughout, almost entirely on practical sets, and
                on location in England, Iceland, Spain, and Scotland. It was promoted with a marketing campaign that included
                viral activities on the web. Three videos featuring the film's leading actors in character, which expanded
                on elements of the fictional universe, were released and met with a generally positive reception and awards.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prometheus was released on June 1, 2012, in the United Kingdom and on June 8, 2012, in North America. It grossed over $403
                million worldwide. Reviews praised both the film's visual aesthetic design and the acting, most notably Fassbender's
                performance as the android David. However, the plot drew a mixed response from critics, who criticized plot
                elements that remained unresolved or were predictable. A sequel, Alien: Covenant, is scheduled to be released
                on May 19, 2017.

            <p>
                As a spacecraft departs a planet, a humanoid alien drinks an iridescent liquid and then dissolves. The remains of the alien
                cascade into a waterfall. The alien's DNA strands mix with the water.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2089, archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover a star map in Scotland that matches others from several
                unconnected ancient cultures. They interpret this as an invitation from humanity's forerunners, the "Engineers".
                Peter Weyland, the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation, funds an expedition to follow the map to the distant
                moon LV-223 aboard the scientific vessel Prometheus. The ship's crew travels in stasis while the android
                David monitors their voyage. Arriving in December 2093, mission director Meredith Vickers informs them of
                their mission to find the Engineers, and not to make contact without her permission.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Prometheus lands on the barren, mountainous surface near a large artificial structure, which a team explores. Inside
                they find stone cylinders, a monolithic statue of a humanoid head, and the decapitated corpse of a large
                alien, thought to be an Engineer; Shaw recovers its head. The crew finds other bodies, leading them to surmise
                the species is extinct. Crew members Millburn and Fifield grow uncomfortable with the discoveries and attempt
                to return to Prometheus, but become stranded in the structure when they get lost. The expedition is cut short
                when a storm forces the crew to return to the ship. David secretly takes a cylinder from the structure, while
                the remaining cylinders begin leaking a dark liquid. In the ship's lab, the Engineer's DNA is found to match
                that of humans. David investigates the cylinder and the liquid inside. He intentionally taints a drink with
                the liquid and gives it to the unsuspecting Holloway, who had stated he would do anything for answers. Shortly
                after, Shaw and Holloway have sex.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the structure, a snake-like creature kills Millburn and sprays a corrosive fluid that melts Fifield's helmet. Fifield
                falls face-first into a puddle of dark liquid. When the crew returns, they find Millburn's corpse. David
                separately discovers a control room containing a surviving Engineer in stasis, and a star map highlighting
                Earth. Meanwhile, Holloway sickens rapidly. He is rushed back to Prometheus, but Vickers refuses to let him
                aboard, and at his urging, burns him to death with a flamethrower. Later, a medical scan reveals that Shaw,
                despite being sterile, is pregnant. Fearing the worst, she uses an automated surgery table to extract a squid-like
                creature from her abdomen. Shaw then discovers that Weyland has been in stasis aboard Prometheus. He explains
                that he wants to ask the Engineers to prevent his death from old age. As Weyland prepares to leave for the
                structure, Vickers addresses him as "Father".
            </p>
            <img id="gifimages" src="images/tenor.gif">
            <p>
                A monstrous, mutated Fifield returns to the Prometheus and kills several crew members before he is killed. The Prometheus's
                captain, Janek, speculates that the structure was an Engineer military installation that lost control of
                a virulent biological weapon, the dark liquid. He also determines that the structure houses a spacecraft.
                Weyland and a team return to the structure, accompanied by Shaw. David wakes the Engineer from stasis and
                speaks to him in an attempt to explain what Weyland wants. The Engineer responds by decapitating David and
                killing Weyland and his team, before reactivating the spacecraft. Shaw flees and warns Janek that the Engineer
                is planning to release the liquid on Earth, convincing him to stop the spacecraft. Janek ejects the lifeboat
                and rams Prometheus into the alien craft, while Vickers flees in an escape pod. The Engineer's disabled spacecraft
                crashes onto the ground, killing Vickers. Shaw goes to the lifeboat and finds her alien offspring is alive
                and has grown to gigantic size. David's still-active head warns Shaw that the Engineer is pursuing her. The
                Engineer forces open the lifeboat's airlock and attacks Shaw, who releases her alien offspring onto the Engineer;
                it thrusts an ovipositor down the Engineer's throat, subduing him. Shaw recovers David's remains, and with
                his help, launches another Engineer spacecraft. She intends to reach the Engineers' homeworld in an attempt
                to understand why they wanted to destroy humanity.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the lifeboat, an Alien creature bursts out of the Engineer's chest.

            <p>
                Development on a fifth film in the Alien franchise was in progress by 2002. Scott considered returning to the series he created
                with his 1979 science fiction horror film Alien, to pursue a sequel that would explore the engineered origins
                of the series's Alien creatures, and the "space jockey"â€”the extraterrestrial being, who briefly appears in
                Alien, as the deceased pilot of a derelict spaceship. Alien star Sigourney Weaver also expressed interest
                in returning to the series.[66] Aliens director James Cameron discussed the potential for a sequel with Scott,
                and began working with another writer on a story for the film. It was then that 20th Century Fox approached
                Cameron with a script for a crossover film that would pit the series's monsters against the title characters
                of the Predator films; this project became the 2004 science fiction film Alien vs. Predator. After Fox confirmed
                that it would pursue the crossover, Cameron stopped working on his own project, believing the crossover would
                "kill the validity of the franchise." In 2006, Cameron confirmed that he would not return to the Alien sequel
                project, believing that the series was Fox's asset, and he was unwilling to deal with the studio's attempts
                to influence the potential sequel.
            </p>
            <p>
                In May 2009, Fox said that the project was a "reboot" of the Alien franchise, and soon afterwards was reported as an untitled
                prequel to Alien. Development stopped in June 2009 when Fox clashed with Scott over his selection of former
                television advertisement director Carl Erik Rinsch as director. Fox was only interested in pursuing the project
                if Scott directed. By July 2009, Scott was contracted to direct the film, and screenwriter Jon Spaihts was
                hired to write the script based on his pitched idea for a direct Alien prequel. With the director and writer
                in place, and pleased with Spaihts's pitch, Fox scheduled a release date for December 2011, but this was
                eventually canceled. In June 2010, Scott announced that the script was complete and that pre-production would
                begin, and a filming date was set for January 2011. Fox eventually pushed to develop the project into an
                original work, and by July 2010, Lindelof had been hired to redevelop Spaihts's screenplay. In October 2010,
                Lindelof submitted his rewritten screenplay to Fox. Scott had initially requested a $250 million budget and
                an adult oriented project, but Fox was reluctant to invest this amount of money, and wanted to ensure the
                film would receive a lower age-rating to broaden the potential audience.
            </p>
            <img id="gifimages" src="images/raw.gif">
            <p>
                In December 2010, it was reported that the film would be called Paradise,[16] named after John Milton's poem Paradise Lost,
                but Scott considered that this would convey too much information about the film. Fox CEO Thomas Rothman suggested
                Prometheus, which was confirmed as the title in January 2011. A release date was scheduled for March 9, 2012,
                but weeks later the release was postponed until June 8, 2012. With the name confirmed, the production team
                began to publicly distance the film from its Alien origins, and were deliberately vague about the connection
                between the films, believing it would build audience anticipation for Prometheus. Scott stated that "while
                Alien was indeed the jumping-off point for this project, out of the creative process evolved a new, grand
                mythology and universe in which this original story takes place. The keen fan will recognize strands of Alien's
                DNA, so to speak, but the ideas tackled in this film are unique, large and provocative."[82] In June 2011,
                Scott and Lindelof confirmed that Prometheus takes place in the same universe as the events of the Alien
                series. In July 2011, Scott stated that "by the end of the third act you start to realize there's a DNA of
                the very first Alien, but none of the subsequent films."
            </p>
            <h4>Pre-production</h4>
            <p>
                Pre-production began in April 2010. A team developed graphic designs for the film. Scott convinced Fox to invest millions
                of dollars to hire scientists and conceptual artists to develop a vision of the late 21st century. The production
                of Prometheus was marked by a high degree of secrecy and story details were kept "extremely under-wraps."
                Ridley Scott was determined to maintain the secrecy of the plot, and he required the cast to sign clauses
                to prevent them disclosing story details, and the cast were allowed to read the script only under supervision
                in Scott's production office. One exception was made when a courier flew to one actor outside the US, and
                then stood guard while the actor read the script. Scott said, "I was insistent that the script not leak onto
                the internet, where it gets dissected out of context, which spoils it for everyone."
            </p>
            <p>
                In July 2011, Lindelof said that the film would rely upon practical effects, and would use CGI generally for on-set pre-visualization
                of external space visuals. Scott said that "you can pretty much do anything you want" with digital technology,
                and, "Doug Trumbull once said to me 'If you can do it live, do it live.' That was 29 years ago. Even though
                we have remarkable digital capabilities I still say do it live. It's cheaper." Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski
                convinced Scott that it would be possible to film in 3D with the same ease and efficiency of 2D filming.
                3D company 3ality Technica provided some of the rigs and equipment to facilitate 3D filming, and trained
                the film's crew in their proper operation. According to Scott, the decision to film in 3D added $10 million
                to the film's budget. Since 3D films need high lighting levels on set, the hallmark dark and shadowy atmosphere
                of the Alien films was added in post-production using color grading processes, and the 3D equipment was based
                on post-Avatar technology.
            </p>
            <h4>Critical reception</h4>
            <img id="gifimages" src="images/giphy.gif">
            <p>
                The film garnered a 72% approval rating from 278 criticsâ€”an average rating of 6.9 out of 10â€”on the review-aggregation website
                Rotten Tomatoes, which said, "Ridley Scott's ambitious quasi-prequel to Alien may not answer all of its big
                questions, but it's redeemed by its haunting visual grandeur and compelling performancesâ€”particularly Michael
                Fassbender as a fastidious android."[209] Metacritic provides a score of 65 out of 100 from 42 critics, which
                indicates "generally favorable" reviews. CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave
                the film was a "B" on a scale of A+ to F, with audience members under 25 rating it the highest at A-. Reviews
                frequently praised both the film's visual aesthetic and design, and Fassbender's performance as the android
                David received almost universal acclaim. However the plot drew a mixed response from critics, who criticized
                plot elements that remained unresolved or were predictable, tempered by appreciation for the action and horror
                set-pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Hollywood Reporter's Todd McCarthy called the film's visuals vivid, stunning, and magnificent on a technical level, and
                praised the performances of Fassbender, Rapace, and Theron, but wrote that the film "caters too much to imagined
                audience expectations when a little more adventurous thought might have taken it to some excitingly unsuspected
                destinations."[215] Time Out London's Tom Huddleston wrote that "the photography is pleasingly crisp and
                the design is stunning", but that, "[t]he script feels flat ... the dialogue is lazy, while the plot, though
                crammed with striking concepts, simply fails to coalesce. After an enjoyable setup, the central act is baggy,
                confusing and, in places, slightly boring, while the climax has flash and fireworks but no real momentum."[216]
                Emanuel Levy wrote that the writing was his only complaint about the film, which, he said, "is not only uneven,
                but promises more original ideas and thematic provocations than it can possibly deliver." Roger Ebert gave
                the film 4 out of 4 stars, labeling it a "seamless blend of story, special effects and pitch-perfect casting,
                filmed in sane, effective 3-D that doesn't distract." Ebert wrote that Rapace's performance "continues here
                the tradition of awesome feminine strength begun by Sigourney Weaver in Alien", but considered that Elba's
                Janek has the most interesting character evolution. Ebert thought that the plot raises questions and does
                not answer them, which made the film intriguing and parallel to the "classic tradition of golden age sci-fi".
                He later went on to name it as one of the best films of 2012.
            </p>
            <p>
                Total Film's Jonathan Crocker wrote that the plot successfully integrated itself with Alien's mythology while offering its
                own original ideas. Entertainment Weekly's Lisa Schwarzbaum was positive towards the cast, particularly Rapace,
                and the cinematography. Salon's Andrew O'Hehir wrote that the film was "somber, spectacular and ponderous,"
                but that the "portentousness and grandiosity ... is at once the film's great strength and great weakness"
                and criticized the characters for lacking common sense. O'Hehir also mentioned Wolski's cinematography and
                Max's production design. The New York Times' A. O. Scott criticized the story as weak, and argued that the
                narrative's twists and reversals undermine its "lofty, mindblowing potential". He said the film has no revelations,
                just "bits of momentarily surprising information bereft of meaning or resonance", and that Rapace is a "fine
                heroine, vulnerable and determined".
            </p>
            <p>
                Variety film critic Justin Chang wrote that the film's narrative structure was unable to handle the philosophical dimension
                of the plot, and that Prometheus was lazily deferring key plot points under the presumption that a sequel
                would be made. The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw wrote that Prometheus was "more grandiose, more elaborateâ€”but
                less interesting" than Alien, and lacked the latter's "central killer punch". Ian Nathan of Empire magazine
                was unimpressed by Rapaceâ€”whom he described as an unconvincing leadâ€”and said that with "a lack of suspense,
                threadbare characters, and a very poor script, the stunning visuals, gloopy madness, and sterling Fassbenderiness
                can't prevent Prometheus feeling like Alien's poor relation." The Village Voice's Nick Pinkerton wrote that
                the film is "prone to shallow ponderousness", and that Scott "can still mimic the appearance of an epic,
                noble, important movieâ€”but the appearance is all." He criticized Rapace and Marshall-Green for failing to
                instill interest in their characters' relationship, but added: "there are a few set pieces here that will
                find a place of honor among aficionados of body horror and all things clammy and viscous".

                James Cameron said: "I enjoyed Prometheus. I thought it was great. I thought it was Ridley returning to science fiction with
                gusto, with great tactical performance, beautiful photography, great native 3D. There might have been a few
                things that I would have done differently, but that's not the pointâ€”you could say that about any movie."

            <p>
                The premiere of Prometheus took place on May 31, 2012, at the Empire cinema in Leicester Square, London. The film was released
                in the United Kingdom on June 1, 2012, and in North America on June 8, 2012. It was simultaneously released
                in IMAX theaters and in 3D, and it is encoded for D-Box motion seats that provide physical feedback to the
                audience during the film. In the United Kingdom, approximately Â£1 million ($1.6 million) of tickets were
                pre-sold. 18,827 tickets pre-sold for the London IMAX, the largest IMAX screen in the country, which broke
                the theater records for the highest grossing week of pre-sales with Â£293,312 ($474,687), and the highest
                grossing first day of pre-sales with Â£137,000 ($221,717).It extended this record to 30,000 tickets sold and
                Â£470,977 ($737,588) earned, and become the most pre-booked film at that theater, exceeding the performance
                of high-profile IMAX releases including Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 and Avatar.

                In North America, audience tracking showed high interest among males, but low among females. In the week before the film's
                release, predictions were conflicted on whether Prometheus or Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (the first
                family-oriented film of the summer), which were released simultaneously, would reach number 1 for that weekend.
                On June 6, 2012, Fandango reported that with 42% of daily sales Prometheus was beating Madagascar 3. The
                online tracking for Prometheus surged with each additional promotional footage. Prometheus was predicted
                to earn approximately $30 million, and Madagascar 3 around $45 million. As the weekend approached, tracking
                suggested a $55 million debut for Madagascar 3 and $50â€“$55 million for Prometheus. Prometheus was disadvantaged
                by Madagascar opening in 264 more theaters and its adult rating.

            <h4 id="music">Music</h4>
            <p>
                Prometheus (soundtrack) Marc Streitenfeld, who had worked with Scott on earlier projects, composed the musical score for
                Prometheus. It took just over a week to record with a 90-piece orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London,
                England. Streitenfeld began writing ideas for the score after reading the script before filming commenced.
                He used some unusual techniques to compose the score, and said, "I actually wrote out the sheet music backwards
                so the orchestra played it backwards and then I digitally flipped it. So you're hearing the score as it's
                written, the same melody, but with a backwards sounding orchestra which gives it a kind of unusual, unsettling
                sound."The Prometheus (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) album was released on iTunes on May 15, 2012,
                and on CD on June 4, 2012. It features 23 tracks by Streitenfeld and two supplemental tracks by Harry Gregson-Williams.
                FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chopin's "Raindrop prelude" (1838) is also featured in the film.

            <img id="gifimages" src="images/gip.gif">
            <p>
                In 2013, a comic book series was announced by Dark Horse Comics that serves as a spin-off to Prometheus. The series, titled
                Fire and Stone, is an Alien vs. Predator crossover featuring content exclusive to Prometheus. The first issue
                of Fire and Stone was released on September 10, 2014.
            </p>
            <h4>Sequels</h4>
            <p>
                On March 17, 2012, Scott said that the film leaves many questions unanswered and that these could be answered in a sequel.
                He said, "If we're lucky, there'll be a second part. It does leave you with some nice open questions." Asked
                whether a sequel would be a direct prequel to Alien, Lindelof said: "If we're fortunate enough to do a sequel
                ... it will tangentialize even further away from the original Alien." In June 2012, Lindelof said that while
                plot elements were deliberately left unresolved so that they could be answered in a sequel, he and Scott
                had thoroughly discussed what should be resolved so that Prometheus could stand alone, as a sequel was not
                guaranteed. Scott said that a sequel would follow Shaw to her next destination, "because if it is paradise,
                paradise cannot be what you think it is. Paradise has a connotation of being extremely sinister and ominous."
                Lindelof cast doubt on his participation, and said, "if Scott wants me to be involved in something, that
                would be hard to say no to. At the same time, I do feel like [Prometheus] might benefit from a fresh voice
                or a fresh take or a fresh thought." Scott said that an additional film would be required to bridge the gap
                between the Prometheus sequel and Alien.Scott later stated it would take an additional two sequels to bridge
                the gap to Alien.
            </p>
            <p>
                As of August 1, 2012, Fox was pursuing a sequel with Scott, Rapace, and Fassbender involved, and was talking to new writers
                in case Lindelof did not return. The film would be scheduled for a release no earlier than 2014. In December
                2012, Lindelof had decided not to work on a sequel, citing other commitments. In June 2013, Jack Paglen was
                in negotiations to write the sequel. In October 2013, Scott confirmed that the script was complete, but in
                March 2014, Michael Green was hired to rewrite Paglen's script. In August 2015, it was announced that production
                for the film would begin in January 2016 with Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace reprising their roles,
                and Scott directing. While at the Toronto International Film Festival to promote his film The Martian, Scott
                stated that production on the film will begin in February 2016. In September 2015, Scott said that the title
                of the sequel will be Alien: Paradise Lost, an allusion to John Milton's epic poem which may also suggest
                a deeper connection with the Alien franchise. In an interview with Empire, Scott said that the title change
                did not affect the film's story and the film will have a connection to the character of Ellen Ripley.

                In October 2015, Deadline.com reported that Rebecca Ferguson is in negotiations for a role.[261] In November 2015, Scott
                announced that the film was retitled Alien: Covenant. In December 2015, Deadline reports that actress Katherine
                Waterston was cast in the lead role of Daniels. Alien: Covenant will take place ten years after the events
                of Prometheus. Scott has stated that the sequel will be a hard R rating. In February 2016, Danny McBride
                entered negotiations to join the film as a crew member of the Covenant ship, along with Demian Bichir, Jussie
                Smollett, Amy Seimetz, Carmen Ejogo, Callie Hernandez, Alex England and Billy Crudup joining the cast.
            </p>

            <h4>Viral campaign</h4>
            <p>
                A viral marketing campaign began on February 28, 2012, with the release of a video featuring a speech by Pearce, in character
                as Peter Weyland, about his vision for the future. Set in 2023, the video presents a futuristic vision of
                a TED conference, an annual technology and design event held in Long Beach, California. The segment was conceived
                and designed by Scott and Lindelof, and directed by Scott's son, Luke. The production was made in collaboration
                with, and made available through TED because Lindelof wanted to introduce new audiences to the conference
                itself. Lindelof said that the scene takes place in a futuristic stadium because "a guy like Peter Weylandâ€”whose
                ego is just massive, and the ideas that he's advancing are nothing short of hubrisâ€”that he'd basically say
                to TED, 'If you want me to give a talk, I'm giving it in Wembley Stadium.
            </p>
            <p>
                TED community director Tom Rielly helped the film's producers gain approval for the use of the TED brand, which had not previously
                been used for promotional purposes. Rielly was involved in designing the 2023 conference, and said that the
                association generated millions of unique visits to the TED website.The video's release was accompanied by
                a fictional TED blog about the 2023 conference and a tie-in website for the fictional Weyland Corporation.[168][169]
                On March 6, 2012, the Weyland website was updated to allow visitors to invest in the company as part of a
                game, which would reveal new Prometheus media.
            </p>

            <p>
                During the 2012 WonderCon, attendees at the film's panel were given Weyland Corporation business cards that directed them
                to a website and telephone number. After calling the number, the caller was sent a text message from Weyland
                Corporation that linked them to a video that was presented as an advertisement for the "David 8" android,
                narrated by Fassbender.An extended version of the video, released on April 17, 2012, lists the android's
                features, including its ability to seamlessly replicate human emotions without the restrictions of ethics
                or distress. A full page "David 8" advertisement was placed in The Wall Street Journal; a Twitter account
                operated by a David8, that allowed Twitter users to ask the character questions, was included. A partnership
                with Verizon FiOS was launched, offering a virtual tour of the Prometheus spaceship. Another video, "Quiet
                Eye", starring Rapace as Shaw, was released on May 16, 2012, and debuted on the Verizon FIOS Facebook page.
                In a telephone call monitored by Yutani, a fictional company from the Alien series, Shaw requests Weyland's
                aid to seek out alien life. In France, the Saint-Martin ghost train station was converted to resemble alien
                architecture from the film, and was visible to passing commuters. The campaign continued after the film's
                release with a website that was listed during the film's end credits. The site referenced the philosophical
                novel Thus Spoke Zarathustra by Friedrich Nietzsche, and featured a video of Weyland, who quotes from the
                book. Another video followed in September 2012, featuring Elba's Captain Janek preparing for a mission.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the May 2012 Digital Hollywood conference, Lindelof said that the videos originated from the question of the film's status
                as an Alien prequel. It was decided that creating videos with the film's stars would generate more interest
                than any commentary about its connection to the Alien films. He also said that the videos needed to be cool
                enough to justify their existence, but not so important that their absence from the final film would be an
                issue for audiences.
            </p>
            <h4>Marketing</h4>
            <p>
                Prometheus' marketing campaign began on July 21, 2011 at the San Diego Comic-Con International, where images and footage
                from the film were presented by Lindelof and Theron; Scott and Rapace participated via satellite contribution.
                A segment of the footage showed Theron performing naked push-ups, which attracted much attention. A teaser
                poster was released on December 14, 2011, with the tagline, "The search for our beginning could lead to our
                end." A bootleg recording of an incomplete trailer was leaked online on November 27, 2011, but was swiftly
                taken down by Fox.The trailer was released on December 22, 2011.
            </p>
            <p>
                On March 17, 2012, Scott, in partnership with AMC Theaters, hosted the premiere of the first full Prometheus trailer at the
                AMC Downtown Disney during WonderCon in Anaheim, California. The event was streamed live via Facebook, Twitter,
                and the AMC Theater website, and the trailer was posted on AMC's YouTube channel immediately after its debut.
                Reactions to the trailer from WonderCon attendees, and on Twitter, were generally positive, and it received
                nearly three million views in the three days following its release.On April 10, 2012, media outlets were
                shown a 13-minute montage of scenes in 3D from the film's opening at the Vue Cinema in Leicester Square,
                London. The screening, and in particular the 3D visuals and the performances of Fassbender, Rapace, Theron,
                and Elba, was well received.
            </p>
            <p>
                On April 29, 2012, the international launch trailer debuted in the United Kingdom on Channel 4 during the first advertisement
                break of the TV show Homeland. Viewers were encouraged to share their opinions about the trailer on Twitter,
                some of which were then shared in a live broadcast during a later break. This was the first time that viewers'
                tweets were used in a broadcast advertisement. A competition, offering viewers a chance to win tickets to
                the film whenever the social platform Zeebox detected the advertisement airing, was launched on that site.
                On May 8, 2012, the advertisement became the subject of an investigation by the British broadcasting regulatory
                body Ofcom for allegedly breaching broadcast rules when a voiceover encouraged viewers to book tickets during
                the advertisement with the Channel 4 logo onscreen. The broadcast potentially broke a ruling that advertising
                and teleshopping must be clearly distinguishable from editorial content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although marketers typically avoid promoting adult-oriented films to reach a broader demographic, the film attracted several
                promotional partners including Coors, Amazon, and Verizon FiOS, which were estimated to have spent $30 million
                in marketing support. Amazon directed interested users to purchase tickets through Fandango, and placed promotional
                material in products shipped to customers; this was the first time that Amazon had allowed such marketing
                by an external company. The premiere in London was streamed live via the film's website and the Verizon FiOS
                Facebook page. The event was facilitated by BumeBox, which took audience questions from social sites and
                gave them to reporters to ask at the event.The National Entertainment Collectibles Association (NECA) released
                a series of Prometheus action figures in September 2012. A book, Prometheus: The Art of the Film, containing
                production art and behind-the-scenes photographs, was released on June 12, 2012
            </p>
            <h4 id="design">Design</h4>
            <p>
                Production designer Arthur Max led the film's design staff. His art team were tasked with deconstructing the art and visuals
                of Alien, and reverse-designing them for the chronologically earlier setting of Prometheus. Influence was
                drawn from the work of Alien creature designer H. R. Giger, and designers Ron Cobb and Chris Foss, including
                their designs for that film which Scott had been unable to develop at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the crew's space suits, Scott was inspired to include spherical glass helmets after reading a story in Steve Jobs' biography
                about building an office out of Gorilla Glass. Scott said, "If I'm in 2083 and I'm going into space, why
                would I design a helmet that has blind spots. What I want is something where I have 360 vision. Glass, by
                then, will be light and you won't be able to break it with a bullet."The interior of the prop helmets had
                nine functioning video screens, internal lighting, an air supply provided by two fans, and battery packs
                concealed within a backpack. The helmet's exterior featured a functional light source and high definition
                video cameras with a transmitter and recorder. For the suit itself, Scott wanted to avoid the unwieldy NASA-style
                suit. His frequent collaborator, Janty Yates, used medical research concepts relating to skin replacement
                treatments and materials to develop a garment that would be believable, flexible and comfortable. The outfit
                comprised a neoprene suit worn under an outer space suit, a base to which the helmet could be attached, and
                a backpack.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aboard the ship, Yates gave the characters their own distinct looks. Theron is dressed in an ice-silver, silk mohair suit.
                Yates said, "Theron is the ice queen. It was always our vision to make her look as sculptural as possible".
                Fassbender's David is dressed similarly to other crew members, but his outfit was given finer lines to produce
                a more linear appearance. To create a casual, relaxed appearance, Marshall-Green's Holloway was dressed in
                hoodies, fisherman pants, and flip-flops, while Elba wore a canvas-greased jacket to represent his long career
                at the helm of a ship.
            </p>
            <h4>Sets and vehicles</h4>
            <p>
                Arthur Max designed the sets such as the alien world landscape and structures, and the vehicles, including the Prometheus
                and the Engineer's ship. Digital 3D models and miniature replicas of each set were built to allow the designers
                to envisage the connections between them and to know where the CGI elements would be inserted. To better
                blend the practical and the digital, the design team took rock samples from the Iceland location so they
                could match the graphical textures with the real rocks. To create the Prometheus, Max researched NASA and
                European Space Agency spacecraft designs, and extended these concepts with his own ideas of how future space
                vehicles might look. He said that he wanted "to do something that was state-of-the-art, which would represent
                a flagship spacecraft with every technology required to probe into the deepest corners of the galaxy."
            </p>
            <p>
                The interior of the Prometheus was built across a two-level structure, fronted by a large, faceted, wrap around windscreen.
                Theron's quarters were designed to represent her high status in the crew, and were furnished with modern
                and futuristic items, including Swarovski chandeliers and a Fazioli piano. The ship's garage was built on
                the backlot of Pinewood Studios in England. The vehicles inside were built in 11 weeks and were designed
                to operate on difficult terrain while having a futuristic aesthetic. Max created a large pyramid structure
                for the alien world, which had its main interior areas connected by a series of chambers, corridors, and
                tunnels; it was so large that some members of the film crew became lost inside it. The pyramid was enhanced
                in post-production to further increase its size. One of the key sets, the chamber where the crew find the
                humanoid-head statue, was designed to resemble the interior of a cathedral and convey a quasi-religious impression.Giger
                designed the murals that appear within the chamber.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the scene of the Prometheus' descent to the alien moon LV-223, visual effects art director Steven Messing referenced
                NASA imagery, including vortex cloud structures. He also used aerial photographs of locations in Iceland
                and Wadi Rum shot by VFX supervisor Richard Stammers and his team. Messing painted over these images and
                combined them with 3D set extensions to create a realistic altered landscape. Scott wanted the ship's descent
                scenes to have a sense of grandeur to contrast the dark and shrouded descent featured in Alien. Much of LV-223s
                world was based upon the world visited in Alien, but scaled back as Scott felt some elements were too unrealistic.
                Other influences were the Martian mountain Olympus Mons and several large mountain structures on Earth. NASA
                advisers provided concepts for the aesthetics of alien worlds which were incorporated into the design work.
                MPC developed a digital representation of Wadi Rum using the design material, modified it to locate the alien
                pyramid and a landing area for the Prometheus, and resized the planet's natural features relative to the
                alien structures.

            <h4>Creature effects</h4>
            <p>
                Neal Scanlan and Conor O'Sullivan developed the film's alien creatures, aiming to convey that each creature has a logical
                biological function and purpose. Scanlan said that much of Scott's inspiration for creature design is drawn
                from natural life, such as plants and sea creatures.Creature designer Carlos Huante chose to make the creature
                designs pale to contrast the black-toned, Giger-influenced aesthetic of Alien. Huante designed them to be
                white and embryonic because the events in the film occur before Giger's influence had taken effect. Huante
                took influences from references Scott was using to design the pale-skinned Engineers. Huante also referenced
                other Giger works, national monuments, large sculptures, and the Crazy Horse Memorial statue in South Dakota.
                Part of Huante's early design work included developing precursors to Alien's Facehugger, and a primitive
                Alien creature, but these were cut from the final release. When designing the Engineers, Scott and Huante
                referenced paintings by William Blake and J. M. W. Turner, and classical sculptures.Scott wanted the Engineers
                to resemble Greco-Roman gods, and instructed designer Neville Page to reference the Statue of Liberty, Michelangelo's
                David, and Elvis Presley.The 8-foot tall, humanoid Engineers were created by applying bulky, full-body prosthetics
                to the actors, whose facial features were diminished by the material, and were later digitally enhanced to
                preserve the "godlike" physical perfection.Scott described the Engineers as tall, elegant "dark angels".
            </p>
            <p>
                The snake-like alien dubbed the "Hammerpede" was given life through a mixture of CGI and practical effects, and the wires
                controlling the practical puppet were digitally removed. For a scene in which the Hammerpede is decapitated,
                the VFX team digitally animated and inserted the spontaneous growth of a replacement head.During the scene
                in which the Hammerpede erupts from Spall's character's corpse, Scott controlled the puppet using wires.
                Scott did not inform Dickie about what was to occur in the scene and her screaming reaction was real. The
                creature's design was partially inspired by translucent sea creatures with visible arteries, veins, and organs
                beneath the skin's surface, and cobras. The designers gave the creature a smooth, muscular, and powerful
                appearance. Early designs of the "Trilobite", the tentacled offspring cut from Shaw, resembled an octopus
                or squid. Page redeveloped this creature as an embryo in an early state of development, with tentacles that
                began fused together and would gradually split, creating new tentacles, as the creature developed.The practical
                creature was a remotely operated animatronic creation with a silicone skin.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mutated Fifield effects were achieved mainly through the use of make-up and prosthetics. Due to concerns that the practical
                effects would be unsatisfactory, the filmmakers completed an alternative version of the sequence, in which
                Fifield was rendered as "a digital character with elongated limbs and an engorged, translucent head, incorporating
                a semblance of Harris's face". Three other variations of the mutated Fifield were modeled, but these were
                rejected as being too inhuman.
            </p>
            <p>
                For its grown form, the "Adult Trilobite", Max found inspiration from an arthropod-like creature from Earth's Cambrian period,
                and the alien octopus in Jean Giraud's illustrations for the comic strip The Long Tomorrow. Further inspiration
                came after Max found a formaldehyde-preserved giant squid, an image which met with Scott's approval. The
                film's last-unveiled creature, the "Deacon", was named by Scott for its long, pointed head that he considered
                resembled a bishop's mitre. Scanlan aimed to represent the creature's genetic lineage, beginning with Shaw
                and Holloway who produce the Trilobite which impregnates the Engineer, in its design. However, they focused
                on making the creature feminine, and said that "it was born of a female before being born of a male." Messing
                drew inspiration for the Deacon's birth scene from the birth of foals, and created an iridescent appearance
                for its skin, based on the equine placenta.The Deacon's protruding jaw was inspired by the goblin shark.

                    Noomi Rapace as Elizabeth Shaw: Rapace described Shaw, an archaeologist, as a believer in God with a very strong faith, and
                    said that, "In the middle of the movie, things happen and she changes into more of a warrior. And in
                    the end, she's such a survivor."To aid her method acting, she developed a complete backstory for Shaw,
                    and worked with a dialect coach to achieve a British accent.She also asked her make-up artist to apply
                    extra blood and sweat during filming to more accurately portray her character.Rapace said, "I was out
                    there filming for about six months and it was super-intense, my body was in so much pain sometimes but
                    it was absolutely amazing." She dismissed comparisons to the Alien franchise's Ellen Ripley. Rapace came
                    to director Ridley Scott's attention for her performance as Lisbeth Salander in the 2009 drama film The
                    Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. She met Scott in August 2010, and by January 2011 she had secured the role.
                    Actresses Anne Hathaway, Natalie Portman, Gemma Arterton, Carey Mulligan, and Abbie Cornish were all
                    considered for the role during development.Lucy Hutchinson, who was eight years old in 2012, portrays
                    Shaw as a child.

                    Charlize Theron as Meredith Vickers: Vickers is a Weyland Corporation employee who is sent to monitor the expedition. Theron
                    described the character as "a suit who slowly sheds [her] skin through the film", and also as "somewhat
                    of a villain ... who definitely has an agenda". She stated "Vickers is pragmatic, and desperately wants
                    to control the situation."Scott wanted the character to lurk in the background of scenes watching other
                    characters instead of being the focus. Theron said that this helped layer her character because "you're
                    just so suspicious of her, instantly." The similarities between the appearances and mannerisms of Vickers
                    and David were intended to raise the possibility that David was based on Vickers's DNA, or that Vickers
                    is an android herself.After Theron was cast in the role, she developed three new scenes with Scott and
                    Lindelof to expand her character.Physical action scenes, some of which involved her running through sand
                    in 30-pound (14 kg) boots were a problem for Theron. It was intended that Theron would portray Shaw,
                    but a prior commitment to Mad Max: Fury Road prevented her involvement. When that film was delayed, she
                    was able to rejoin Prometheus.Michelle Yeoh and Angelina Jolie were considered for the role.

                    David is an android that acts as the ship's butler and maintenance man. It is designed to be indistinguishable from humans,
                    and begins to develop "its own ego, insecurities, jealousy and envy". Writer Damon Lindelof stated that
                    the character provides a non-human perspective on the film's events, and said, "what does the movie look
                    like from the robot's point of view? If you were to ask him, 'What do you think about all of this? What's
                    going on? What do you think about these humans who are around you?' Wouldn't it be cool if we found a
                    way for that robot to answer those questions?"Fassbender said, "David's views on the human crew are somewhat
                    childlike. He is jealous and arrogant because he realizes that his knowledge is all-encompassing, and
                    therefore he is superior to the humans. David wants to be acknowledged and praised for his brilliance".In
                    developing his character, Fassbender avoided watching the android characters of Alien (1979) and Aliens
                    (1986), and instead studied the replicants in Scott's 1982 science fiction film Blade Runner, with a
                    focus on Sean Young's character Rachael, whose "vacancy" and longing for a soul interested him.Fassbender
                    drew further inspiration from the voice of the HAL 9000 computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey,the "funny
                    walk and economy of movement" of Olympic diver Greg Louganis, and the performances of David Bowie in
                    The Man Who Fell to Earth, Dirk Bogarde in The Servant, and Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia. David's
                    blond hair was modeled on that of T. E. Lawrence.

                    Logan Marshall-Green as Charlie Holloway: Holloway is an archaeologist and Shaw's love interest. Marshall-Green was cast
                    after he was seen performing on stage "off-off-off Broadway". He described Holloway as the "X Games-type
                    scientist", and said that he liked the character's "leap-before-looking" philosophy. He also said that
                    Holloway "doesn't want to meet his maker. He wants to stand next to his maker. He's willing to go to
                    the edge to get that."Describing the character's motivation, he said: "he goes to the extreme in everything
                    he does, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse of the Prometheus crew. I think what drives
                    him is the thrill of the search." Marshall-Green contrasted Holloway with Shaw, and said: "she's the
                    believer. I'm the scientist. I'm the skeptic. I'm the atheist".
