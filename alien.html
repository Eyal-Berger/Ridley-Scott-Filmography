            <p>
                Alien is a 1979 British-American science fiction horror film directed by Ridley Scott, and starring Tom Skerritt, Sigourney
                Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm and Yaphet Kotto. The film's title refers
                to a highly aggressive extraterrestrial creature that stalks and kills the crew of a spaceship. Dan O'Bannon
                wrote the screenplay from a story he wrote with Ronald Shusett, drawing influence from previous works of
                science fiction and horror. The film was produced by Gordon Carroll, David Giler and Walter Hill through
                their Brandywine Productions and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Giler and Hill made revisions and additions
                to the script. Shusett was executive producer. The eponymous Alien and its accompanying elements were designed
                by Swiss surrealist artist H. R. Giger, while concept artists Ron Cobb and Chris Foss designed the human
                aspects of the film. Alien launched the Alien franchise and is chronologically the first of the main series,
                with the prequel series set in an earlier timeframe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alien received both critical acclaim and box office success, receiving an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, Saturn Awards
                for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction for Scott, and Best Supporting Actress for Cartwright, and
                a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, along with numerous other award nominations. It has remained
                highly praised in subsequent decades, being considered one of the greatest films of all time. In 2002, the
                film was deemed "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant" by the Library of Congress and was
                selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. In 2008, it was ranked as the seventh-best
                film in the science fiction genre by the American Film Institute, and as the 33rd greatest film of all time
                by Empire magazine.
            </p>
            <p>
                The success of Alien spawned a media franchise of novels, comic books, video games, and toys. It also launched Weaver's acting
                career by providing her with her first lead role, and the story of her character Ellen Ripley's encounters
                with the Alien creatures became the thematic thread that ran through the sequels Aliens (1986), Alien 3 (1992)
                and Alien: Resurrection (1997).A crossover with the Predator franchise produced the Alien vs. Predator series,
                which includes Alien vs. Predator (2004) and Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007). A prequel series, which
                includes Prometheus (2012) and Alien: Covenant (2017), continues in development.

            <h4 id="plot">Plot</h4>
            <p>
                The commercial spacecraft Nostromo is on a return trip to Earth with a seven-member crew in stasis: Captain Dallas (Skerritt),
                Executive Officer Kane (Hurt), Navigator Lambert (Cartwright), Science Officer Ash (Holm), Warrant Officer
                Ripley (Weaver), and Engineers Parker (Kotto) and Brett (Stanton). Detecting a mysterious transmission from
                a nearby planetoid— possibly a distress signal—the ship's computer, Mother, awakens the crew. Following standard
                company policy for such situations, the Nostromo lands on the planetoid, sustaining damage from the planetoid's
                dusty atmosphere in the process. Parker and Brett begin repairing the ship, while Dallas, Kane, and Lambert
                head out to investigate. They discover the signal is coming from a derelict alien spacecraft. Inside, they
                find the remains of a large alien creature whose rib cage appears to have exploded from the inside.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the Nostromo, Ripley determines that the transmission is not a distress signal but a warning. Ash responds by telling
                her that she wouldn't be able to communicate with the others in time. In the alien ship, Kane discovers a
                chamber containing hundreds of eggs. As he inspects one, a creature springs out and attaches itself to his
                face. Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo. As acting senior officer, Ripley
                refuses to let them aboard, citing quarantine regulations, but Ash violates protocol by overriding Ripley's
                lock and letting them in. The crew unsuccessfully attempt to remove the creature from Kane's face, discovering
                that its blood is an extremely corrosive acid. It detaches on its own and is found dead.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the ship repaired, the crew lifts off. Kane awakens with some memory loss but otherwise unharmed. However, during the
                crew's final meal before re-entering stasis, he chokes and convulses in pain before a small alien creature
                bursts from his chest, killing him, and escapes into the depths of the ship. Since attacking the creature
                with conventional weapons could result in its corrosive blood breaching the ship's hull, the crew attempts
                to locate and capture it with motion trackers, nets, electric prods, and flamethrowers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Brett follows the crew's cat, Jones, into an engine room and the now fully grown alien (Badejo) attacks him and disappears
                with his body into the air shafts. After a heated discussion, the group devises a plan to jettison the creature
                out of the ship. Dallas enters the Nostromo's labyrinthine ventilation shafts, intending to force the alien
                into an airlock, but it ambushes him. Lambert, realizing the alien is killing the crew one by one, implores
                the others to escape in the ship's shuttle. Now in command, Ripley explains that the shuttle will not support
                four people, and recommends that they continue with Dallas' plan of flushing the alien out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Accessing Mother, Ripley discovers that Ash has secretly been ordered to return the alien to the crew's employers, who consider
                the crew expendable. When Ripley confronts Ash, he tries to choke her to death. Parker intervenes and knocks
                off Ash's head, revealing him to be an android. Parker reanimates Ash's head, and Ripley interrogates him.
                They learn he was assigned to the Nostromo to convince the crew to capture the creature and return it for
                analysis, even at the expense of the human personnel. Ash taunts them about their chances of survival against
                the "perfect organism." Parker turns a flamethrower on Ash.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ripley, Lambert and Parker agree to set the Nostromo to self-destruct and escape in the shuttle. However, Parker and Lambert
                are ambushed and killed by the alien while gathering life-support supplies. Ripley initiates the self-destruct
                sequence and heads for the shuttle with Jones, but the alien blocks her path. She retreats and unsuccessfully
                attempts to abort the self-destruct sequence, then returns to retrieve Jones, finding the alien gone. She
                narrowly escapes in the shuttle as the Nostromo explodes.
            </p>
            <p>
                As she prepares to enter stasis, Ripley discovers the alien is aboard the shuttle. She dons a spacesuit and opens the shuttle's
                airlock, causing explosive decompression which forces the alien into the shuttle's open doorway. She propels
                it into space by shooting it with a grappling hook, but the gun catches in the closing door, tethering the
                alien to the shuttle. It attempts to crawl into one of the engines but Ripley then activates them, blasting
                the alien into space. After recording the ship's final log entry, she places herself and Jones into stasis
                for the voyage home.

            <p>
                While studying cinema at the University of Southern California, Dan O'Bannon had made a science fiction comedy film with
                director John Carpenter and concept artist Ron Cobb entitled Dark Star.The film included an alien which had
                been created using a spray-painted beach ball, and the experience left O'Bannon "really wanting to do an
                alien that looked real."A "couple of years" later he began working on a similar story that would focus more
                on horror: "I knew I wanted to do a scary movie on a spaceship with a small number of astronauts", he later
                recalled, "Dark Star as a horror movie instead of a comedy."Ronald Shusett, meanwhile, was working on an
                early version of what would eventually become Total Recall.Impressed by Dark Star, he contacted O'Bannon
                and the two agreed to collaborate on their projects, choosing to work on O'Bannon's film first as they believed
                it would be less costly to produce. O'Bannon had written twenty-nine pages of a script titled Memory comprising
                what would become the film's opening scenes: a crew of astronauts awaken to find that their voyage has been
                interrupted because they are receiving a signal from a mysterious planetoid. They investigate and their ship
                breaks down on the surface. He did not yet, however, have a clear idea as to what the alien antagonist of
                the story would be.
            </p>
            <p>
                O'Bannon soon accepted an offer to work on Alejandro Jodorowsky's film adaptation of Dune, a project which took him to Paris
                for six months.Though the project ultimately fell through, it introduced him to several artists whose works
                gave him ideas for his science-fiction story including Chris Foss, H. R. Giger, and Jean "Moebius" Giraud.
                O'Bannon was impressed by Foss's covers for science fiction books, while he found Giger's work "disturbing":
                "His paintings had a profound effect on me. I had never seen anything that was quite as horrible and at the
                same time as beautiful as his work. And so I ended up writing a script about a Giger monster."After the Dune
                project collapsed O'Bannon returned to Los Angeles to live with Shusett and the two revived his Memory script.
                Shusett suggested that O'Bannon use one of his other film ideas, about gremlins infiltrating a B-17 bomber
                during World War II, and set it on the spaceship as the second half of the story. The working title of the
                project was now Star Beast, but O'Bannon disliked this and changed it to Alien after noting the number of
                times that the word appeared in the script. He and Shusett liked the new title's simplicity and its double
                meaning as both a noun and adjective. Shusett came up with the idea that one of the crew members could be
                implanted with an alien embryo that would later burst out of him, feeling that this was an interesting plot
                device by which the alien creature could get aboard the ship.
            </p>
            <p>
                In writing the script, O'Bannon drew inspiration from many previous works of science fiction and horror. He later stated
                that "I didn't steal Alien from anybody. I stole it from everybody!"The Thing from Another World (1951) inspired
                the idea of professional men being pursued by a deadly alien creature through a claustrophobic environment.
                Forbidden Planet (1956) gave O'Bannon the idea of a ship being warned not to land, and then the crew being
                killed one by one by a mysterious creature when they defy the warning.Planet of the Vampires (1965) contains
                a scene in which the heroes discover a giant alien skeleton; this influenced the Nostromo crew's discovery
                of the alien creature in the derelict spacecraft.O'Bannon has also noted the influence of "Junkyard" (1953),
                a short story by Clifford D. Simak in which a crew lands on an asteroid and discovers a chamber full of eggs.
                He has also cited as influences Strange Relations by Philip José Farmer (1960), which covers alien reproduction,
                and various EC Comics horror titles carrying stories in which monsters eat their way out of people.
            </p>
            <p>
                With roughly eighty-five percent of the plot completed, Shusett and O'Bannon presented their initial script to several studios,pitching
                it as "Jaws in space."[40] They were on the verge of signing a deal with Roger Corman's studio when a friend
                offered to find them a better deal and passed the script on to Gordon Carroll, David Giler, and Walter Hill,
                who had formed a production company called Brandywine with ties to 20th Century Fox.O'Bannon and Shusett
                signed a deal with Brandywine, but Hill and Giler were not satisfied with the script and made numerous rewrites
                and revisions to it.This caused tension with O'Bannon and Shusett, since Hill and Giler had very little experience
                with science fiction and according to Shusett: "They weren't good at making it better, or in fact at not
                making it even worse."O'Bannon believed that they were attempting to justify taking his name off of the script
                and claiming it as their own. Hill and Giler did add some substantial elements to the story, however, including
                the android character Ash which O'Bannon felt was an unnecessary subplot,but which Shusett later described
                as "one of the best things in the movie...That whole idea and scenario was theirs."in total Hill and Giler
                went through eight different drafts of the script, mostly concentrating on the Ash subplot but also making
                the dialogue more natural and trimming some sequences set on the alien planetoid.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the multiple rewrites, 20th Century Fox did not express confidence in financing a science-fiction film. However,
                after the success of Star Wars in 1977 the studio's interest in the genre rose substantially. According to
                Carroll: "When Star Wars came out and was the extraordinary hit that it was, suddenly science fiction became
                the hot genre." O'Bannon recalled that "They wanted to follow through on Star Wars, and they wanted to follow
                through fast, and the only spaceship script they had sitting on their desk was Alien". Alien was greenlit
                by 20th Century Fox at an initial budget of $4.2 million.Alien was funded by American dollars, but made by
                Twentieth Century-Fox's British production subsidiary.
            </p>
            <h4>Post-production</h4>
            <p>
                Editing and post-production work on Alien took roughly twenty weeks to complete.Terry Rawlings served as Editor, having previously
                worked with Scott on editing sound for The Duellists.Scott and Rawlings edited much of the film to have a
                slow pace to build suspense for the more tense and frightening moments. According to Rawlings: "I think the
                way we did get it right was by keeping it slow, funny enough, which is completely different from what they
                do today. And I think the slowness of it made the moments that you wanted people to be sort of scared...then
                we could go as fast as we liked because you've sucked people into a corner and then attacked them, so to
                speak. And I think that's how it worked."The first cut of the film was over three hours long; further editing
                trimmed the final version to just under two hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                One scene that was cut from the film occurred during Ripley's final escape from the Nostromo: she encounters Dallas and Brett
                who have been partially cocooned by the Alien. O'Bannon had intended the scene to indicate that Brett was
                becoming an Alien egg while Dallas was held nearby to be implanted by the resulting facehugger.Production
                Designer Michael Seymour later suggested that Dallas had "become sort of food for the alien creature", while
                Ivor Powell suggested that "Dallas is found in the ship as an egg, still alive."Scott remarked that "they're
                morphing, metamorphosing, they are changing into...being consumed, I guess, by whatever the Alien's organism
                is...into an egg."The scene was cut partly because it did not look realistic enough and partly because it
                slowed the pace of the escape sequence.Tom Skerritt remarked that "The picture had to have that pace. Her
                trying to get the hell out of there, we're all rooting for her to get out of there, and for her to slow up
                and have a conversation with Dallas was not appropriate." The footage was included amongst other deleted
                scenes as a special feature on the Laserdisc release of Alien, and a shortened version of it was re-inserted
                into the 2003 "Director's Cut" which was re-released in theaters and on DVD.

            <h4 id="casting">Casting</h4>
            <img id="gifimages" src="images/relax.gif">
            <p>
                Casting calls and auditions for Alien were held in both New York and London. With only seven human characters in the story,
                Scott sought to hire strong actors so he could focus most of his energy on the film's visual style.He employed
                casting director Mary Selway, who had worked with him on The Duellists, to head the casting in the United
                Kingdom, while Mary Goldberg handled casting in the United States.In developing the story O'Bannon had focused
                on writing the Alien first, putting off developing the characters for a later draft.He and Shusett had therefore
                written all of the roles as generic male ones with a note in the script explicitly stating "The crew is unisex
                and all parts are interchangeable for men or women." This left Scott, Selway, and Goldberg free to interpret
                the characters as they liked and to cast accordingly. They wanted the Nostromo's crew to resemble working
                astronauts in a realistic environment, a concept summed up as "truckers in space".According to Scott, this
                concept was inspired partly by Star Wars, which deviated from the pristine future often depicted in science
                fiction films of the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                To assist the actors in preparing for their roles, Ridley Scott wrote several pages of backstory for each character explaining
                their histories. He filmed many of their rehearsals in order to capture spontaneity and improvisation, and
                tensions between some of the cast members, particularly towards the less-experienced Weaver, translated convincingly
                on film as tension between their respective characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Film critic Roger Ebert notes that the actors in Alien were older than was typical in thriller films at the time, which helped
                make the characters more convincing:
            </p>
            <p>
                None of them were particularly young. Tom Skerritt, the captain, was 46, Hurt was 39 but looked older, Holm was 48, Harry
                Dean Stanton was 53, Yaphet Kotto was 42, and only Veronica Cartwright at 30 and Weaver at 29 were in the
                age range of the usual thriller cast. Many recent action pictures have improbably young actors cast as key
                roles or sidekicks, but by skewing older, Alien achieves a certain texture without even making a point of
                it: These are not adventurers but workers, hired by a company to return 20 million tons of ore to Earth.

                David McIntee, author of Beautiful Monsters: The Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide to the Alien and Predator Films, asserts
                that part of the film's effectiveness in frightening viewers "comes from the fact that the audience can all
                identify with the characters...Everyone aboard the Nostromo is a normal, everyday, working Joe just like
                the rest of us. They just happen to live and work in the future."

            <h4 id="filming">Filming</h4>
            <p>
                Alien was filmed over fourteen weeks from July 5 to October 21, 1978. Principal photography took place at Shepperton Studios
                near London, while model and miniature filming was done at Bray Studios in Water Oakley, Berkshire.Production
                time was short due to the film's low budget and pressure from 20th Century Fox to finish on schedule.A crew
                of over 200 workmen and technicians constructed the three principal sets: The surface of the alien planetoid
                and the interiors of the Nostromo and derelict spacecraft.Art Director Les Dilley created 1/24th scale miniatures
                of the planetoid's surface and derelict spacecraft based on Giger's designs, then made moulds and casts and
                scaled them up as diagrams for the wood and fiberglass forms of the sets. Tons of sand, plaster, fiberglass,
                rock, and gravel were shipped into the studio to sculpt a desert landscape for the planetoid's surface, which
                the actors would walk across wearing space suit costumes.The suits themselves were thick, bulky, and lined
                with nylon, had no cooling systems and, initially, no venting for their exhaled carbon dioxide to escape.Combined
                with a heat wave, these conditions nearly caused the actors to pass out and nurses had to be kept on-hand
                with oxygen tanks. For scenes showing the exterior of the Nostromo, a 58-foot (18 m) landing leg was constructed
                to give a sense of the ship's size. Ridley Scott still did not think that it looked large enough, so he had
                his two sons and the son of Derek Vanlint, the cinematographer, stand in for the regular actors, wearing
                smaller space suits to make the set pieces seem larger. The same technique was used for the scene in which
                the crew members encounter the dead alien creature in the derelict spacecraft. The children nearly collapsed
                due to the heat of the suits, and eventually oxygen systems were added to assist the actors in breathing.Four
                identical cats were used to portray Jones, the Nostromo crew's pet.During filming Sigourney Weaver discovered
                that she was allergic to the combination of cat hair and the glycerin placed on the actors' skin to make
                them appear sweaty. By removing the glycerin she was able to continue working with the cats.

                Alien originally was to conclude with the destruction of the Nostromo while Ripley escapes in the shuttle Narcissus. However,
                Ridley Scott conceived of a "fourth act" to the film in which the Alien appears on the shuttle and Ripley
                is forced to confront it. He pitched the idea to 20th Century Fox and negotiated an increase in the budget
                to film the scene over several extra days. Scott had wanted the Alien to bite off Ripley's head and then
                make the final log entry in her voice, but the producers vetoed this idea as they believed that the Alien
                had to die at the end of the film.
            </p>

            <h4 id="music">Music</h4>
            <p>
                The musical score for Alien was composed by Jerry Goldsmith, conducted by Lionel Newman, and performed by the National Philharmonic
                Orchestra. Ridley Scott had originally wanted the film to be scored by Isao Tomita, but 20th Century Fox
                wanted a more familiar composer and Goldsmith was recommended by then-President of Fox Alan Ladd, Jr.Goldsmith
                wanted to create a sense of romanticism and lyrical mystery in the film's opening scenes, which would build
                throughout the film to suspense and fear. Scott did not like Goldsmith's original main title piece, however,
                so Goldsmith rewrote it as "the obvious thing: weird and strange, and which everybody loved." Another source
                of tension was editor Terry Rawlings' choice to use pieces of Goldsmith's music from previous films, including
                a piece from Freud: The Secret Passion, and to use an excerpt from Howard Hanson's Symphony No. 2 ("Romantic")
                for the end credits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scott and Rawlings had also become attached to several of the musical cues they had used for the temporary score while editing
                the film, and re-edited some of Goldsmith's cues and re-scored several sequences to match these cues and
                even left the temporary score in place in some parts of the finished film. Goldsmith later remarked that
                "you can see that I was sort of like going at opposite ends of the pole with the filmmakers of the picture."
                Nevertheless, Scott praised Goldsmith's score as "full of dark beauty"and "seriously threatening, but beautiful."It
                was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score, a Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack Album,
                and a BAFTA Award for Best Film Music. The score has been released as a soundtrack album in several versions
                with different tracks and sequences.

                An initial screening of Alien for 20th Century Fox representatives in St. Louis suffered from poor sound in the theater.
                A subsequent screening in a newer theater in Dallas went significantly better, eliciting genuine fright from
                the audience.Two theatrical trailers were shown to the public. The first consisted of rapidly changing still
                images set to some of Jerry Goldsmith's electronic music from Logan's Run. The second used test footage of
                a hen's egg set to part of Goldsmith's Alien score.The film was previewed in various American cities in the
                spring of 1979 and was promoted by the tagline "In space no one can hear you scream."
            </p>
            <p>
                Alien was rated "R" in the United States, "X" in the United Kingdom, and "M" in Australia. In the UK, the British Board of
                Film Classification almost passed the film as an "AA" (for ages 14 and over), although there were concerns
                over the prevalent sexual imagery. 20th Century Fox eventually relented in pushing for an AA certificate
                after deciding that an X rating would be a better choice commercially for selling a horror film.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alien opened in American theaters on May 25, 1979. The film had no formal premiere, yet moviegoers lined up for blocks to
                see it at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood where a number of models, sets, and props were displayed
                outside to promote it during its first run. Religious zealots set fire to the model of the space jockey,
                believing it to be the work of the devil. In the United Kingdom, Alien premiered at a gala performance at
                the Edinburgh Film Festival on September 1, 1979, before starting an exclusive run at the Odeon Leicester
                Square in London on September 6, 1979, but it did not open widely in Britain until January 13, 1980.

            <h4 id="sequels">Sequels</h4>
            <p>
                The success of Alien led 20th Century Fox to finance three direct sequels over the next eighteen years, each by different
                writers and directors. Sigourney Weaver remained the only recurring actor through all four films, and the
                story of her character Ripley's encounters with the Aliens became the thematic thread running through the
                series.James Cameron's Aliens (1986) focused more on action and involved Ripley returning to the planetoid
                accompanied by marines to confront hordes of Aliens.David Fincher's Alien 3 (1992) had nihilistic tones and
                found her on a prison planet battling another Alien, ultimately sacrificing herself to prevent her employers
                from acquiring the creatures. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Alien: Resurrection (1997) saw Ripley resurrected through
                cloning to battle more Aliens even further in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                The success of the film series resulted in the creation of a media franchise with numerous novels, comic books, video games,
                toys, and other media and merchandise appearing over the years. A number of these began appearing under the
                Alien vs. Predator crossover imprint, which brought the Alien creatures together with the titular Predators
                of the Predator franchise. The film series eventually followed suit, with Paul W. S. Anderson's Alien vs.
                Predator (2004) and Colin and Greg Strause's Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007). These stories are set in
                the 2000s.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sigourney Weaver has expressed interest in reuniting with Ridley Scott to revive her character for another Alien film. In
                the 2003 commentary track for the Alien DVD included in the Alien Quadrilogy set, she and Scott both speculated
                on the possibility, with Weaver stating: "There is an appetite for a fifth one, which is something I never
                expected...it's really hard to come up with a fifth story that's new and fresh...but I have wanted to go
                back into space...I think outer space adventure is a good thing for us right now, 'cause Earth is so grim...so
                we've been talking about it, but very generally." Scott remarked that, if the series were to continue, the
                most logical course would be to explore the origins of the space jockey and the Aliens. Weaver supported
                this idea, stating that "I think it would be great to go back, because I'm asked that question so many times:
                'Where did the Alien come from?' People really want to know in a very visceral way."David Giler stated that
                he, Walter Hill, and Gordon Carroll, the producers of the first four films in the series, would not be willing
                to produce another unless it was about the Aliens' homeworld and Weaver was on board (although they were
                among the producers of Aliens vs. Predator and its sequel). Weaver, in turn, indicated that she would only
                return to the franchise if either Scott or James Cameron were directing. Cameron had been working on a story
                for a fifth Alien film which would explore the origins of the creatures, but ceased work on it when he learned
                that Fox was pursuing Alien vs. Predator, which he felt would "kill the validity of the franchise". Weaver
                has continued to express interest in another installment, stating in 2008 that "I would definitely do another
                if I had a director like Ridley Scott and we had a good idea. Ridley is enthusiastic about it."

                In July 2009, 20th Century Fox announced that Jon Spaihts had been hired to write a prequel to Alien, with Scott attached
                to direct.The script was subsequently re-worked by Scott and Damon Lindelof. Titled Prometheus, it went into
                production in May 2011, and was subsequently released in 2012. Scott released a statement: "While Alien was
                indeed the jumping-off point for this project, out of the creative process evolved a new, grand mythology
                and universe in which this original story takes place. The keen fan will recognize strands of Alien's DNA,
                so to speak, but the ideas tackled in this film are unique, large and provocative."

                Variety reported on February 18, 2015 that a new Alien film will be directed by Neill Blomkamp. On February 25, it was confirmed
                that Sigourney Weaver would have a role in the film.

            <h4>Imitations</h4>
            <p>
                Alien had both an immediate and long-term impact on the science fiction and horror genres. Shortly after its debut, Dan O'Bannon
                was sued by another writer named Jack Hammer for allegedly plagiarising a script entitled Black Space. However,
                O'Bannon was able to prove that he had written his Alien script first. In the wake of Alien's success a number
                of other filmmakers imitated or adapted some of its elements, sometimes by copying its title. One of the
                first was The Alien Dead (1979), which was titled at the last minute to cash in on Alien's popularity.Contamination
                (1980) was initially going to be titled Alien 2 until 20th Century Fox's lawyers contacted writer/director
                Luigi Cozzi and made him change it, and it built on press coverage of Alien's chestburster scene by having
                many similar creatures, which originated from large, slimy eggs, bursting from characters' chests. An unauthorized
                sequel to Alien, titled Alien 2: On Earth, was released in 1980 and included alien creatures which incubate
                inside human hosts. Other science fiction films of the time that borrowed elements from Alien include Galaxy
                of Terror (1981), Inseminoid (1981), Forbidden World (1982), Xtro (1982), and Dead Space (1991).

            <p>
                The film studio The Asylum has produced two mockbusters based on the Alien franchise: AVH: Alien vs. Hunter (based on the
                crossover Alien vs. Predator: Requiem) and Alien Origin (based on Prometheus).

            <h4>Analysis</h4>
            <p>
                Critics have analyzed Alien's sexual overtones. Following Barbara Creed's analysis of the Alien creature as a representation
                of the "monstrous-feminine as archaic mother," Ximena Gallardo C. and C. Jason Smith compared the facehugger's
                attack on Kane to a male rape and the chestburster scene to a form of violent birth, noting that the Alien's
                phallic head and method of killing the crew members add to the sexual imagery. The film's script author,
                Dan O'Bannon, has argued that the scene is a metaphor for the male fear of penetration, and that the "oral
                invasion" of Kane by the facehugger functions as "payback" for the many horror films in which sexually vulnerable
                women are attacked by male monsters. McIntee claims that "Alien is a rape movie as much as Straw Dogs (1971)
                or I Spit on Your Grave (1978), or The Accused (1988). On one level it's about an intriguing alien threat.
                On one level it's about parasitism and disease. And on the level that was most important to the writers and
                director, it's about sex, and reproduction by non-consensual means. And it's about this happening to a man."
                He notes how the film plays on men's fear and misunderstanding of pregnancy and childbirth, while also giving
                women a glimpse into these fears. Film analyst Lina Badley has written that the Alien's design, with strong
                Freudian sexual undertones, multiple phallic symbols, and overall feminine figure, provides an androgynous
                image conforming to archetypal mappings and imageries in horror films that often redraw gender lines. O'Bannon
                himself later described the sexual imagery in Alien as overt and intentional: "One thing that people are
                all disturbed about is sex... I said 'That's how I'm going to attack the audience; I'm going to attack them
                sexually. And I'm not going to go after the women in the audience, I'm going to attack the men. I am going
                to put in every image I can think of to make the men in the audience cross their legs. Homosexual oral rape,
                birth. The thing lays its eggs down your throat, the whole number.'
            </p>
            <p>
                In the decades since its original release, critics have analyzed and acknowledged Alien's roots in earlier works of fiction.
                It has been noted as having similarities with earlier science fiction films such as The Thing from Another
                World (1951), Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), It! The Terror from Beyond Space (1958), Night of the
                Blood Beast (1958), and Queen of Blood (1966), as well as fellow 1970s horror films Jaws (1975) and Halloween
                (1978).Literary connections have also been suggested, including thematic comparisons to And Then There Were
                None (1939). Many critics have also suggested that the film derives in part from A. E. van Vogt's The Voyage
                of the Space Beagle (1950), particularly its stories "The Black Destroyer", in which a cat-like alien infiltrates
                the ship and hunts the crew, and "Discord in Scarlet", in which an alien implants parasitic eggs inside crew
                members which then hatch and eat their way out. O'Bannon, however, denies that this was a source of his inspiration
                for Alien's story.Van Vogt initiated a lawsuit against 20th Century Fox over the similarities, but Fox settled
                out of court. Rick Sanchez of IGN noted the "striking resemblance" to Mario Bava's cult classic Planet of
                the Vampires (1965), especially in a celebrated sequence in which the crew discovers a ruin containing the
                skeletal remains of long dead giant beings, and in the design and shots of the ship itself, similar to the
                derelict spacecraft in Alien. Despite the visual similarities, both O'Bannon and director Ridley Scott claimed
                in a 1979 interview that they had not seen Planet of the Vampires.
            </p>
            <p>
                Writer David McIntee has also noted similarities to the Doctor Who episode "The Ark in Space" (1975), in which an insectoid
                queen alien lays larvae inside humans which later eat their way out, a life cycle inspired by that of the
                ichneumon wasp. He has also noted similarities between the first half of the film, particularly in early
                versions of the script, to H.P. Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness, "not in storyline, but in dread-building
                mystery",and calls the finished film "the best Lovecraftian movie ever made, without being a Lovecraft adaptation",
                due to its similarities in tone and atmosphere to Lovecraft's works.In 2009, Dan O'Bannon said the film was
                "strongly influenced, tone-wise, by Lovecraft, and one of the things it proved is that you can't adapt Lovecraft
                effectively without an extremely strong visual style ... What you need is a cinematic equivalent of Lovecraft's
                prose." Regarding O'Bannon's initial Alien storyline, H. R. Giger stated, "I liked it particularly because
                I found it was in the vein of Lovecraft, one of my greatest sources of inspiration."
