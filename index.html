            <h4 id="ridley">Ridley Scott</h4>
            <p>
                Sir Ridley Scott (born 30 November 1937) is an English film director and producer. Following his commercial breakthrough
                with the science-fiction horror film Alien (1979), his best known works are the neo-noir dystopian science
                fiction film Blade Runner (1982), crime drama Thelma & Louise (1991), historical drama and Best Picture Oscar
                winner Gladiator (2000), war film Black Hawk Down (2001), crime thriller Hannibal (2001), biographical film
                American Gangster (2007), and science fiction films Prometheus (2012) and The Martian (2015).
            </p>
            <p>
                Scott is known for his atmospheric, highly concentrated visual style. Though his films range widely in setting and period,
                they frequently showcase memorable imagery of urban environments, whether 2nd century Rome (Gladiator), 12th
                century Jerusalem (Kingdom of Heaven), Medieval England (Robin Hood), contemporary Mogadishu (Black Hawk
                Down), or the future cityscapes of Blade Runner. His films are also known for their strong female characters.
                Scott has been nominated for three Academy Awards for Directing (for Thelma & Louise, Gladiator and Black
                Hawk Down). In 1995, both Ridley and his brother Tony received the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Contribution
                To Cinema. In 2003, Scott was knighted for his "services to the British film industry". In 2015, he was awarded
                an honorary doctorate by the Royal College of Art in London.
            </p>

            <h4 id="early">Early life and career</h4>
            <p>
                Scott was born in South Shields, County Durham, North East England,[8] to Elizabeth (Williams) and Colonel Francis Percy
                Scott. He was brought up in an army family, so for most of his early life, his father – an officer in the
                Royal Engineers – was absent. His elder brother, Frank, joined the British Merchant Navy when he was still
                young and the pair had little contact. During this time the family moved around, living in (among other areas)
                Cumberland in North West England, Wales and Germany. He had a younger brother, Tony, who also became a film
                director. After World War II, the Scott family moved back to their native North East, eventually settling
                on Greens Beck Road in Hartburn, County Durham, whose industrial landscape would later inspire similar scenes
                in Blade Runner. He studied at Grangefield Grammar School and West Hartlepool College of Art from 1954 to
                1958, obtaining a diploma in design.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scott went on to study at the Royal College of Art in London, contributing to college magazine ARK and helping to establish
                the college film department. For his final show, he made a black and white short film, Boy and Bicycle, starring
                both his younger brother and his father (the film was later released on the "Extras" section of The Duellists
                DVD). In February 1963 Scott was named in title credits as "Designer" for the BBC television programme Tonight,
                about the severe winter of 1963. After graduation in 1963, he secured a job as a trainee set designer with
                the BBC, leading to work on the popular television police series Z-Cars and science fiction series Out of
                the Unknown. He was originally assigned to design the second Doctor Who serial, The Daleks, which would have
                entailed realising the serial's eponymous alien creatures. However, shortly before Scott was due to start
                work, a schedule conflict meant he was replaced by Raymond Cusick. In 1965, he began directing episodes of
                television series for the BBC, only one of which, an episode of Adam Adamant Lives!, is available commercially.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1968, Ridley and Tony Scott founded Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), a film and commercial production company. Working alongside
                Alan Parker, Hugh Hudson and cinematographer Hugh Johnson, Ridley Scott made many commercials at RSA during
                the 1970s, including a notable 1973 Hovis advertisement, "Bike Round" (underscored by the slow movement of
                Symphony No. 9 rearranged for brass), set in the north of England but filmed in Gold Hill, Shaftesbury, Dorset.
                A nostalgia themed television advertisement that captured the public imagination, it was voted the UK's all-time
                favourite commercial in a 2006 poll. In the 1970s the Chanel No. 5 brand needed revitalisation having run
                the risk of being labelled as mass market and passé. Directed by Scott in the 1970s and 1980s, Chanel television
                commercials were inventive mini-films with production values of surreal fantasy and seduction, which "played
                on the same visual imagery, with the same silhouette of the bottle."
            </p>
            <p>
                Five members of the Scott family are directors, and all have worked for RSA. His brother Tony was a successful film director
                whose career spanned more than two decades; his sons Jake and Luke are both acclaimed directors of commercials,
                as is his daughter, Jordan Scott. Jake and Jordan both work from Los Angeles; Luke is based in London. In
                1995, Shepperton Studios was purchased by a consortium headed by Ridley and Tony Scott, which extensively
                renovated the studios while also expanding and improving its grounds.

            <p>
                Scott had originally planned next to adapt a version of Tristan and Iseult, but after seeing Star Wars, he became convinced
                of the potential of large scale, effects-driven films. He accepted the job of directing Alien, the 1979 horror/science-fiction
                film that would win him international success. Scott made the decision to switch Ellen Ripley from the standard
                male action hero to a heroine.Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver), who appeared in the first four Alien films,
                would become a cinematic icon.The final scene of John Hurt's character has been named by a number of publications
                as one of the most memorable in cinematic history. Filmed at Shepperton Studios in England, Alien was the
                sixth highest-grossing film of 1979, earning over $104 million worldwide. Scott was involved in the 2003
                restoration and re-release of the original film. In promotional interviews at the time, Scott indicated he
                had been in discussions to make a fifth film in the Alien franchise. However, in a 2006 interview, Scott
                remarked that he had been unhappy about Alien: The Director's Cut, feeling that the original was "pretty
                flawless" and that the additions were merely a marketing tool.Scott would later return to an Alien-related
                project when he directed Prometheus three decades after the original film's release. (See 2006 – present
                section, for more on Prometheus.)

            <h4 id="life">Personal life</h4>
            <p>
                Ridley Scott was married to Felicity Heywood from 1964 to 1975. The couple had two sons, Jake and Luke, both of whom work
                as directors on Scott's production company, Ridley Scott Associates. Scott later married advertising executive
                Sandy Watson in 1979, with whom he had a daughter, Jordan Scott, and divorced in 1989.His current partner
                is the actress Giannina Facio, whom he has cast in all his films since White Squall except American Gangster
                and The Martian.He divides his time between homes in London, France and Los Angeles.
            </p>
            <p>
                His eldest brother Frank died, aged 45, of skin cancer in 1980.His younger brother Tony, who was also his business partner
                in their company Scott Free, died on 19 August 2012 at the age of 68 after jumping from the Vincent Thomas
                Bridge which spans Los Angeles Harbor, after a long struggle with cancer. Before Tony's death, he and Ridley
                collaborated on a miniseries based on Robin Cook's novel, Coma for A&E. The two-part miniseries premiered
                on A&E on 3 September 2012, to mixed reviews.In 2013, Ridley stated that he is an atheist.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ridley has dedicated several of his films in memory of his family: Blade Runner to his brother Frank, Black Hawk Down to
                his mother, and The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings to his brother Tony. Ridley also paid tribute to
                his late brother Tony at the 2016 Golden Globes, after his film, The Martian, won Best Motion Picture – Musical
                or Comedy.

            <p>
                Russell Crowe commented, "I like being on Ridley's set because actors can perform and the focus is on the performers."Paul
                M. Sammon, in his book Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner, commented in an interview with Brmovie.com
                that Scott's relationship with his actors has improved considerably over the years.More recently during the
                filming of Scott's 2012 film, Prometheus, Charlize Theron praised the director's willingness to listen to
                suggestions from the cast for improvements in the way their characters are portrayed on script. Theron worked
                alongside the writers and Scott to give more depth to her character during filming.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scott's work is identified for its striking visuals, with heroines also a common theme.His visual style, incorporating a
                detailed approach to production design and innovative, atmospheric lighting, has been influential on a subsequent
                generation of filmmakers.Scott commonly uses slow pacing until the action sequences. Examples include Alien
                and Blade Runner; the LA Times critic Sheila Benson, for example, would call the latter "Blade Crawler" "because
                it's so damn slow". Another technique he employs is use of sound or music to build tension, as heard in Alien,
                with hissing steam, beeping computers and the noise of the machinery in the space ship. Scott claims to have
                an eidetic memory, which he says aids him in visualising and storyboarding the scenes in his films.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scott has developed a method for filming intricate shots as swiftly as possible: "I like working, always, with a minimum
                of three cameras. So those 50 set-ups [a day] might only be 25 set-ups except I'm covering in the set-up.
                So you're finished. I mean, if you take a little bit more time to prep on three cameras, or if it's a big
                stunt, eleven cameras, and – whilst it may take 45 minutes to set up – then when you're ready you say 'Action!',
                and you do three takes, two takes and is everybody happy? You say, 'Yeah, that's it.' So you move on."
            </p>
            <p>
                Artificial intelligence is a unifying theme throughout Scott's career as a director, particularly in Blade Runner, Alien,
                and Prometheus.The recent book The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott identifies Alan Turing and John
                Searle, a professor at the University of California, as presenting relevant models of testing artificial
                intelligence known as the Turing test and the Chinese Room Thought Experiment, respectively, in the chapter
                titled "What's Wrong with Building Replicants," which has been a recurring theme for many of Scott's films.The
                chapter titled "Artificial Intelligence in Blade Runner, Alien, and Prometheus," concludes by citing the
                writings of John Stuart Mill in the context of Scott's Nexus-6 Replicants in Blade Runner (Rutger Hauer),
                the android Ash (Ian Holm) in Alien, and the android David (Michael Fassbender) in Prometheus, where Mill
                is applied to assert that measures and tests of intelligence must also assess actions and moral behaviour
                in androids to effectively address the themes which Scott explores in these films.
